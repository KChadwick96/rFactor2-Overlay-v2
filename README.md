## Development

### Prerequisites

You must have NodeJS and yarn installed on your machine.

Clone the repo and go to the project folder e.g. `cd Documents/Projects/rfactor-2-overlay`
Then run the following commands

```sh
yarn
```

### Build

To build, simply run `yarn build`
This will create a dist folder with all the compiled files. These can be moved to the webdev folder in your rFactor install (see **Stream Setup** > **rFactor 2** above)
